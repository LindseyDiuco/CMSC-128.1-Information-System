Clinical Laboratory Information System (CLIS) GITHUB REPOSITORY

## **SINAG** (name subject to change) <br />
A web-based clinical laboratory information system designed to streamline the delivery of important health information to clinics and laboratories. This is done by automating certain aspects of healthcare: digitization of case investigation forms of swab test patients, the use of a DRU (disease reporting units) queuing system to deliver sample data on a timely basis, and automatically releasing results once finalized by a pathologist.
